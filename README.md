# Fake News Detection

Fake News Detection in Python

In this project, we have used various natural language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to classify fake news articles using sci-kit libraries from python. 


#### Dataset used
The data source used for this project is LIAR dataset which contains 3 files with .tsv format for test, train and validation. Below is some description about the data files used for this project.
	
LIAR: A BENCHMARK DATASET FOR FAKE NEWS DETECTION

William Yang Wang, "Liar, Liar Pants on Fire": A New Benchmark Dataset for Fake News Detection, to appear in Proceedings of the 55th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2017), short paper, Vancouver, BC, Canada, July 30-August 4, ACL.

the original dataset contained 13 variables/columns for train, test and validation sets as follows:

* Column 1: the ID of the statement ([ID].json).
* Column 2: the label. (Label class contains: True, Mostly-true, Half-true, Barely-true, FALSE, Pants-fire)
* Column 3: the statement.
* Column 4: the subject(s).
* Column 5: the speaker.
* Column 6: the speaker's job title.
* Column 7: the state info.
* Column 8: the party affiliation.
* Column 9-13: the total credit history count, including the current statement.
* 9: barely true counts.
* 10: false counts.
* 11: half true counts.
* 12: mostly true counts.
* 13: pants on fire counts.
* Column 14: the context (venue / location of the speech or statement).


 



### File descriptions

#### DataPrep.py
This file contains all the pre processing functions needed to process all input documents and texts. First we read the train, test and validation data files then performed some pre processing like tokenizing, stemming etc. There are some exploratory data analysis is performed like response variable distribution and data quality checks like null or missing values etc.

#### FeatureSelection.py
In this file we have performed feature extraction and selection methods from sci-kit learn python libraries. For feature selection, we have used methods like simple bag-of-words and n-grams and then term frequency like tf-tdf weighting. we have also used word2vec and POS tagging to extract the features, though POS tagging and word2vec has not been used at this point in the project.

#### classifier.py
Here we have build all the classifiers for predicting the fake news detection. The extracted features are fed into different classifiers. We have used Naive-bayes, Logistic Regression, Linear SVM, Stochastic gradient descent and Random forest classifiers from sklearn. Each of the extracted features were used in all of the classifiers. Once fitting the model, we compared the f1 score and checked the confusion matrix. After fitting all the classifiers, 2 best performing models were selected as candidate models for fake news classification. We have performed parameter tuning by implementing GridSearchCV methods on these candidate models and chosen best performing parameters for these classifier. Finally selected model was used for fake news detection with the probability of truth. In Addition to this, We have also extracted the top 50 features from our term-frequency tfidf vectorizer to see what words are most and important in each of the classes. We have also used Precision-Recall and learning curves to see how training and test set performs when we increase the amount of data in our classifiers.

#### prediction.py
Our finally selected and best performing classifier was ```Logistic Regression``` which was then saved on disk with name ```final_model.sav```. Once you close this repository, this model will be copied to user's machine and will be used by prediction.py file to classify the fake news. It takes an news article as input from user then model is used for final classification output that is shown to user along with probability of truth.

Below is the Process Flow of the project:

    ```
    - After hitting the enter, program will ask for an input which will be a piece of information or a news headline that you 	    	   want to verify. Once you paste or type news headline, then press enter.

    - Once you hit the enter, program will take user input (news headline) and will be used by model to classify in one of  categories of "True" and "False". Along with classifying the news headline, model will also provide a probability of truth associated with it.
